This project was done by Team Red(Shift) Happens which consists of Kelsey Li, Gloria Majchrzak and Stevan Thomas. 

Despite the name, AWS RedShift wasn't used (womp womp!)

Links for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks.  (Spotify Dataset 1922-2021, ~600k Tracks)

We tried a Neural Network, Multinomial Logistic Regression and a xgboost model. Visualizations were done on MongoDB charts.

This was one of our first attempts into a fully fledged machine learning project, so suggestions for improvement are welcome!!

Enjoy!
